Description: >
  Moiré materials have recently garnered significant experimental 
  and theoretical interest due to the presence of a moiré superlattice 
  that effects emergent electronic phases. We are interested in 
  studying strongly correlated electronic phases of various moiré systems 
  using quantum Monte Carlo methods.
