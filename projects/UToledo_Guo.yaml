Description: This study investigates the contribution of secondary neutrons generated
  when therapeutic proton beams interact with metal implants such as hip prostheses,
  spinal rods, and surgical clips. Using Monte Carlo simulations and experimental
  validation, it quantifies neutron spectra and dose equivalents to patients and surrounding
  environments under different beam delivery techniques. The findings aim to guide
  clinical planning and propose mitigation strategies to minimize neutron-related
  risks in proton therapy.
