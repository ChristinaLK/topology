Description: The Tau Air-shower Mountain Based Observatory, TAMBO, is a valley-based
  experiment dedicated to detecting Earth-skimming ultra-high-energy astrophysical
  tau neutrinos. TAMBO functions by observing extensive air showers from tau leptons,
  produced by astrophysical tau neutrinos, that have sufficient energy to emerge from
  rock and decay in air. Simulating these extensive air showers is critical to optimizing
  our experiment and requires significant compute time and resources. https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08070.
