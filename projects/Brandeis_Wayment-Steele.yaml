Description: Understanding protein function in biology depends on understanding the
  multiple conformations they can adopt. We recently adapted AlphaFold in a method
  called "AF-cluster" to predict multiple conformations of proteins with large-scale
  rearrangements in their secondary structure. We are running large-scale screens
  using AF-cluster to identify previously undiscovered biologically-relevant conformational
  changes.
