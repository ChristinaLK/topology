Description: 'Our systems pharmacology approach constructs multi-scale, hybrid computational
  models that describe host immune, pathogen and drug dynamics within an infected
  patient. In close collaborations with experimentalists, we integrate these computational
  models with multiple in vitro and in vivo datasets to: predict drug efficacy, optimize
  treatment, identify new drug targets, and inform future experiments; all in the
  context of complex host-pathogen-drug interactions.'
