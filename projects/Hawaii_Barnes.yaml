Description: 'Mergers transform spiral galaxies into bizarre objects which eventually
  settle down as elliptical galaxies. We observe merging galaxies in different stages
  of this billion-year process. I use computers to simulate galactic collisions, reproducing
  the shapes of galaxy mergers, to understand how mergers transform the galaxies around
  us.
