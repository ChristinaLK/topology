Description: 'This research project aims to model the synthesis of hyaluronan by its
  synthase during both normal membrane-based processive synthesis and during in vitro
  non-processive reactions. Simulations built from kinetic models of the hyaluronan
  synthesis processes will predict product molecular weight distributions and enable
  structure predictions for the glycocalyx on living cells using numerical self consistent
  field theory. Structure predictions will be compared to experimental results for
  brush densities and microparticle penetration based on high resolution single particle
  tracking data. (Institutional Website: https://www.clarkson.edu/people/jan-scrimgeour)'
