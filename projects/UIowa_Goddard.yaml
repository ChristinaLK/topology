Description: Over the past decade, the scale and resource demands of neural networks
  have grown exponentially. Building on previous empirical research, we propose a
  novel algorithm called Layer Collapse, inspired by Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP).
  While IMP offers significant model compression with minimal accuracy loss, it requires
  specialized libraries and hardware for real-world speedups. Layer Collapse overcomes
  these challenges by merging the weights of pruned layers, enabling efficient compression
  without the need for specialized infrastructure.
