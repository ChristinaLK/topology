Description: "Monolayer krypton desorption from graphite shows anomalously strong\
  \ mass dependence relative to Graham\u2019s law. We will determine whether coverage-dependent\
  \ structure, substrate vibrational coupling, or protocol artifacts drive this anomaly,\
  \ and deliver reliable isotope-selective desorption rates for 1\u20136 layers."
